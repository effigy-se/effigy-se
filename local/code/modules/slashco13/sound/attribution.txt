In the process of development; SC13 ran into the awkward spot of discovering some of the SFX used in SlashCo proper were unaccredited; but still royalty free.

Therein; we're taking a sort of middleground approach for development wherein we retain the original SFX from SlashCo proper - whilst adding the
accreditation that was otherwise hidden within the sound's metadata. We do this in good faith to preserve the intended experience whilst mending what was up
originally; and therein honoring SS13's wild history with weird niche copyright fuckery. (From X-Ceed's flip-flap to the Earthbound jukebox...)

Therein; the following sounds are subject to the copyright of Alan McKinney (on behalf of Zapsplat.com):
- slasher/imposter/stealthkill.ogg

Any of the above have no involvement with this project.
