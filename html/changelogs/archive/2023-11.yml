      helmets FOR FREE. No longer does any operative need be shamed by their bald
      helmet's unhatted state when they spot the captain, in their MODsuit, wearing
      a hat on their helmet. The embarrassment has resulted in more than a few operatives
      prematurely detonating their implants! BUT NO LONGER! FASHION IS YOURS!
  - qol: There is now a Core Gear Box, containing a few essential pieces of gear for
      success as an operative. This is right at the top of the uplink, you can't miss
