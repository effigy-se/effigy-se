changes:
  - balance: "Nanotrasen, in direct response to the increasing danger posed by wannabe martial artists and rioters in the fringes of the Spinward Sector, have upgraded the impact dampeners found in their riot armor. Staff have also started to rediscover the value of medieval armor; it isn't particularly easy to topple a knight in a suit of plate with just your fists."
  - balance: "Melee-focused armor is now more able to protect you from various RNG-based knockdowns, such as critical hits from punches (as well as the ones applied through the staggered status), shoves, critical hits with a blunt weapon to the chest, and body throws."
  - balance: "Melee-focused helmets also protect you from head injuries, such as bottle smashes, accidentally hitting something dense during a tackle, and critical hits from a blunt weapon to the head."
  - balance: "Bottlesmash knockdowns are less reliable in general."
  - rscadd: "A new module, the Safety-First Head Protection module, protects you from head trauma! Available in most modsuits expected to take hits to the head often. And from roundstart exofabricators."
