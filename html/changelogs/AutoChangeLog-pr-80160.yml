  - admin: "Object Possession has been reworked, please report any potential bugs."
  - qol: "Object Possession should now throw a screen alert for you to unpossess the object instead of you having to search the stat-panel for the \"release obj\" verb. You can still use the verb but it's a lot nicer now. Aghosting will also work now."
